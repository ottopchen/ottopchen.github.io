I chose to use Jessica Lam's design because of it's simple and clear layout, without too much complexity in the design. I changed it a bit to simplify the layout and make it easier to complete in time, as the inner organization of the icons within each weather day was complex. I also added my own touches in terms of fonts and text shadow. My software has most of the DOM elements created on the fly through javascipt instead of just editing existing HTML elements. Almost all the code is contained within the callback function. I used the view object when I could, but I felt like creating model functions made things unnecessarily complicated for this program. I also edited SVG images to my liking.
